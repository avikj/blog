Hello World!

Here you will find random, unrelated posts about my experiences programming. I'm interested in fields ranging from front-end development to machine learning and algorithms, and I hope I'll be able to use this blog to share some of my own discoveries, experiences, and tips with code-lovers like myself as well as those simply interested in having a basic understanding of or exposure to how different technologies work.
